This solution builds a custom URL protocol handler intended to allow network folders and documents
with local network paths to be launched from a web browser. See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/aa767914
for more information on registering custom URI schemes to a handler.

Each end user must install this handler using the MSI generated by the DocLauncherSetup project.
Installation will deploy the doc launcher executable and add registry keys to register the URI scheme.
Be sure to build the Setup project in Release mode.

The handler will accept the URI scheme "doclaunch:" and launch a new windows process with the
command to the right of the URI scheme. If this command is a file path, web URL, or document path,
the operating system default handler for that command will open the document, website, folder path, etc.
For example: "doclaunch:\\networkdrive\folder" will open \\networkdrive\folder in Windows Explorer

Disclaimer: This is easily exploitable and could be misused if a malicious command is passed in. 
Use at your own risk.

This solution is best built and maintained using Visual Studio 2017 with the "Visual Studio Installer Projects" 
extension installed.
